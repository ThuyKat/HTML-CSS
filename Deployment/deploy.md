# What is deployment

Web -> local network -> global network ( public network) : IP + port
Server depoyment -> Computer which is public on the internet: store the application and start server
Server provider : AWS/Google cloud/azure
Local Server: expensive in terms of hardware cost, maintainance cost - cool room, internet, labour cost 

# Accessibility
- Remote desktop
- Server window
- Linux/Ubuntu : terminal

# SSH ( Sercured Shell protocol)
securly sending commands to a computer over an unsecured network, uses cryptography to authenticate
RSA key: Github, asked everytime push and pull code
SSH key: setup , access by command: ssh username@IP_address --> cd localhost --> cd db, etc --> git status
- Different to backend server

# NGIX : reverse proxy
- github base: pointing to github page --> pages will have .html at the end
- ctl file
- secured access: user access, ngnix to manage bandwidth ( number of access users to the application at a specific point of time)
# Mail server:
- admin, add user
